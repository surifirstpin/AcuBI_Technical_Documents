Reports in  <b> AcuBi</b>  extract the data effectively and collaborate efficiently, instead of accessing the data in a regular traditional manner. Just in matters of seconds, you can confess a story in what way your organisation is making a difference to the world.

Both reports and dashboards can be organised via Work Spaces and later edited as per requirement.
