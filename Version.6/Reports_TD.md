- To create a new report click on <b>Reset Visualization</b> ( refresh icon).

## Adding Dimension and Measure

A <b>Dimension</b> is a group of data and <b>Measure</b> is information about group of data and they collectively acts as fundamental building blocks for a query.

> <b>For Instance :</b> <b>Name of the Employee</b> is defined as dimension and <b>Salary of the Employee</b> is defined as Measure.
 
 <b><i>To retrieve the data in report section follow the below steps,</i></b>
 
<b>2.</b>  Select one or more dimension fields ( Grey fields) to access the data. It supports strings and date types.

<b>3.</b> Select one or more measure fields (Orange fields) to access numeric values, such as Sum, Count, Max, Min and  Avg etc. (Refer Image 1)

  > <b>Note :</b> To hide Explore/Visualize sections  click on  <b>angle double left</b> icon. To display the same click <b>angle double right  (»)</b> icon available above dimensions and measure field list.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
## Filters 

Filters  in AcuBi pull out the data by displaying the filtered information from database. Filters are the advanced way to limit the data. 

<b><i>The following are the various types of filter expressions used:</i></b>

| Type | Description |
|--|--|
| <b>String</b> | For fields that contain letters or special characters |
|<b>Numbers</b>|For fields that contain numeric values|
|<b>Date</b>|For fields that contain dates|
|<b>Lookup</b>| To view the lookup in Report filters it should be derived first under lookup field, in model section|

## Pivot table

Multiple dimensions in report data are often easier to look at, when you pivot one of the dimensions horizontally and display group based data for the field to which pivot is applied. 
To <b>Pivot</b> a dimension click on pivot for dimension before or after running the query.

> <b>Note :</b> You can add more pivots to other dimension fields but make sure you have at least one un-pivoted dimension and a measure value.

<b>For instance:</b> To view number of orders received based on the month it displays in following way:

| Order Received  |year  |month|Region|Name|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|100 |2000|January|north|john|
|200|2001|February|south|Steve|
|300|2002 |march|east|Bob|
|400|2003|April|west|Mecker|

On Applying pivot on month, it displays;
  
|January|February|March|April|
|--|--|--|--|
|100|200|300|400|
|2000|2001|2002|2003|
|North|south|east|west|
|john|Steve|bob|Mecker|

 <b>You can apply pivot to fields in 2 ways :</b>
 
<b>a.</b> Apply pivot <b>After Retrieving</b> the data by selecting the pivot in drop down of the field.

## Drill Down Display

Using drill down you can view more deeper insights of the data. To enable this feature we need to define following code in Model section under prescribed project fields.

>   <b><i>Note 1:</i></b> For " TRUE " option it will display both dimensions and measure field.

```
{
			
			"name": "stationcode",
			"label": "stationcode",
			"data_type": "string",
			"type": "dimension",
			"lookup": "",
			"operators": "",
			"sql": "${TABLE}.stationcode",
			"summary": "",
			"drill_down_fields": "wayused,areacode",
			"show_drill_down_measures": "true",
			"visualise": "true"
		
		},
```


![enter image description here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sv18042016/fp1/a5605d5be15fd6fba7dfd3e99698cdee7b76a553/images/New_version5/TD_Reports_18.png)

  <b><Font color = " black">Image 15</font></b>


><b><i>Note 2: </i></b> Similarly For False, it will display only dimension fields.

```
	{
			"name": "stationcode",
			"label": "stationcode",
			"data_type": "string",
			"type": "dimension",
			"lookup": "",
			"operators": "",
			"sql": "${TABLE}.stationcode",
			"summary": "",
			"drill_down_fields": "wayused,areacode",
			"show_drill_down_measures": "false",
			"visualise": "true"
		},
```




<b>For example:</b> (Consider Image 15)

<b>a.</b> On expanding Station Code, it will display Station code details (eg: area code, way used & quantity)  that fall under the particular station_2.

<b>b.</b> On further expanding Way
used (Phone) for area code SS_z2, it will display the Phone numbers that fall under this particular area code.
