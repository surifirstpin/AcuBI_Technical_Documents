<b>Connection</b> Specifies a database connection from which a model can retrieve the data.
   
 <b>To set up database connection, Follow the below instructions;</b>
    
<b>I.</b>  Get the connection details for database such as Host, Dialects, Port, Username, Password, etc from <b>Database Administrator.</b>

<b>II.</b> Enable secure access to database, such as :
  - Using  IP Address Whitelist, optionally adding SSL Encryption.
  - Using SSH Tunnel, which provides a secured and encrypted connection with extra authentication.
  
<b> III. </b> Set up database to work with AcuBi. Instructions may vary from dialect to dialect. Typically it includes providing approval to AcuBi to access database.

 ## Set-Up Database Connection

 Login <b>AcuBi</b> using following navigation path with your Username and Password :

-  <b>Name:</b> Specify a name to define connection.
 
- <b>Dialect:</b> Choose appropriate dialect based on  connection being established. 
 
- <b>Host:</b>  Database host path.

- <b>Database:</b> Name of the database used.

- <b>Username & Password:</b> Credentials used to connect the database.

- <b>Temporary Database:</b>  To get the data path location of local files for user.

- <b>Maximum connection:</b> Concurrent connection used by  database.

Here you can set up maximum number of connections for your database


- <b>Additional Parameters:</B> Additional JDBC parameter used.

You can include here additional Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) parameters for your queries if needed.

## SSH 

Enable SSH connection by select checkbox for SSH. Select SSH encryption to protect the data as it passes between AcuBi and database. This is one way of securing your data.

<b>a)</b> To connect AcuBi SSH tunnel with same database host, provide following information to AcuBi analyst :
 
- IP address or DNS name of the database server

- SSH port of the database server
 
- Database port number
  
<b>b)</b> If connecting with separate database host, provide following information to AcuBi analyst:
  
- <b>IP address or DNS name</b> of the database server as seen from the tunnel server.
  
- <b>Database port number</b> as seen from the tunnel server.

- <b> IP address or DNS name</b> of the tunnel server as seen from the public internet.
