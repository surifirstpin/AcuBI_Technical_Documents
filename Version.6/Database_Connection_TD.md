<b>Connection</b> Specifies a database connection from which a model can retrieve the data.
   
 <b>To set up database connection, Follow the below instructions;</b>
    
<b>I.</b>  Get the connection details for database such as Host, Dialects, Port, Username, Password, etc from <b>Database Administrator.</b>

<b>II.</b> Enable secure access to database, such as :
  - Using  IP Address Whitelist, optionally adding SSL Encryption.
  - Using SSH Tunnel, which provides a secured and encrypted connection with extra authentication.
  
<b> III. </b> Set up database to work with AcuBi. Instructions may vary from dialect to dialect. Typically it includes providing approval to AcuBi to access database.

 ## Set-Up Database Connection

 Login <b>AcuBi</b> using following navigation path with your Username and Password :
 
[AcuBi Homepage Login](http://192.168.32.20:8081/acubiLogin)

<b>Navigation: Database â†’ New connection</b>

 <b>1.</b> Click on <b>Database Section</b> It navigates to database connections page.

 <b><font color = "Black" >Image 1</font></b>

<b><i><u>Enter the following details in New connection page ;</u></i></b>

-  <b>Name:</b> Specify a name to define connection.
 
- <b>Dialect:</b> Choose appropriate dialect based on  connection being established. 
 
- <b>Host:</b>  Database host path.

- <b>Database:</b> Name of the database used.

- <b>Username & Password:</b> Credentials used to connect the database.

- <b>Temporary Database:</b>  To get the data path location of local files for user.

- <b>Maximum connection:</b> Concurrent connection used by  database.

Here you can set up maximum number of connections for your database


- <b>Additional Parameters:</B> Additional JDBC parameter used.

You can include here additional Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) parameters for your queries if needed.

## SSH 

Enable SSH connection by select checkbox for SSH. Select SSH encryption to protect the data as it passes between AcuBi and database. This is one way of securing your data.

<b>a)</b> To connect AcuBi SSH tunnel with same database host, provide following information to AcuBi analyst :
 
- IP address or DNS name of the database server

- SSH port of the database server
 
- Database port number
  
<b>b)</b> If connecting with separate database host, provide following information to AcuBi analyst:
  
- <b>IP address or DNS name</b> of the database server as seen from the tunnel server.
  
- <b>Database port number</b> as seen from the tunnel server.

- <b> IP address or DNS name</b> of the tunnel server as seen from the public internet.

- <b>SSH port</b> of the tunnel server as seen from the public internet.

<b>3. Dialects:</b> select the accurate dialect from the list using drop down option.

AcuBi allows wide range of SQL database dialects and will continue to improve the feature implementation for existing dialects used as well as for newly added dialects.


## Test Connection

<b>4. Test Connection:</b> Click <b> Test Connection </b> to check if entered information is running accurately and weather the database is able to connect.

> On hitting test connection button, it displays a success message if entered information is correct, if not displays a error message. 

<b>5. Add Connection:</b> Once the data is configured and tested your database connection, click <b> Add Connections.</b>  Once connection is established, you can see the list of connections names under database connection list.
