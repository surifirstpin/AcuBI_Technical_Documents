<h1><center>Interactive Bar</center> </h1>

<b> Functionality :  </b> Interactive bar allows to work with more than one interaction at the same time in single visualization. To implement this we need to define in model section atleast one default measure field and one default dimension field so that we can use multiple measure fields and multiple dimension fields in report section.

  

<b> Interpretation :  </b> Fetching the data in single visualization with multiple measure field and multiple dimension fields gives the complete information regarding the report and saves the business time.

  

<b> Navigation :  </b> First we need to define interactive fields in Model as shown below:

**NOTE**: We need to use one default measure and one default dimension in model which is mandatory.

-   To display the Interactive Bars in Dashboards first we need to create report and select one measure field and one dimension field . Later what ever field is selected in Interactive bar it is displayed in the dashboard as shown below
