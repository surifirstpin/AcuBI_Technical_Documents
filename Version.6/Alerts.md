<b> Interpretation :  </b> While creating a job sometimes the job is delayed or failed and that should be notified to everyone. To inform all the aucbi users in a domain we can prompt an alert message/ notification with start and end time so that a scrolling message will be displayed in the upper part of screen for all the users at the scheduled time ( we can limit the users list also).This message is displayed as an alert .

  

<b>Example : </b>An important message to be displayed on the screen for particular period and if the reports are in maintainenance process is supposed or insisted in the next few hours we can start a notification for all the users intimation, then we can create an alert.
