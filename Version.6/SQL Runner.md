Using SQL Runner, you can directly access the database and clout it in variety of ways. In SQL Runner you can easily set up the connection, and navigate the tables under your schema.  **Run**  pre-written SQL queries and view the query run history. at the same time create your customs views here and perform useful task with them in model section.

**There two ways to create sql queries in AcuBi.**

-   In AcuBi you can directly write the SQL query from scratch and run the same, make sure the dialects used in SQL runner should match the database dialects.
    
-   Create SQL query using analysis section.
    
-   Make use of  **History**  section to pre-run the previous query.
