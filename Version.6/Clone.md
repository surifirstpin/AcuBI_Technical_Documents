## Clone Job

<b> Functionality :  </b>Job cloning allows you to create an exact copy of any backup or replication job available in the job list. In addition to perform job editing tasks, you can add new jobs by means of job cloning.

  

 <b>Interpretation :  </b> While we are dealing with many jobs with different aggregations, we need to aggregate the data with many common columns but a different aggregator. In this purpose we can clone the job which is created for one aggregator  to get the same replica and then change dimensions as per new creteria. This minimise the effort and saves the bussiness time in creating a new job which is almost to previous job but with small differences.

  

In fact this also nullifies the human error while mapping the reference fields from source SQL to target table coloumns.

  <b>Navigation : navigate to SQL Jobs list page.

 <b>1. </b>Go to settings and click  <b> Clone </b> on required job.

## Task Cloning

  

Cloning a task takes the contents of the task and re-creates it as a new task with a different name. This is helpful for when you want to change parts of an existing task without any possible side effects.

  

  

To task clone an existing job:

<b>1.</b> Select the required job and **Edit**

<b>2.</b> Now go to **Settings** icon in task list
